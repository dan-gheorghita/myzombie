# myZombie.py

**Analysis of the Python Code**

The provided Python code is a set of zombie-themed dice games written using the `zombiedice` library. The code defines several zombie classes, each with its own strategy for playing the game. The game is played in a tournament mode, where each zombie player competes against others in a series of games.

**Overview of the Code Structure**

The code is organized into six classes, each representing a different zombie player:

1. `MyZombie`: A custom zombie player with a simple strategy.
2. `BotRandom`: A zombie player that rolls the dice randomly.
3. `BotFour`: A zombie player that rolls the dice four times or until two shotguns are obtained.
4. `MoreBrains`: A zombie player that continues to roll the dice as long as the number of brains obtained is greater than or equal to the number of shotguns obtained.

The code also defines a `zombies` tuple, which contains instances of these zombie classes
